# React Portfolio

## Description

Having a professional portfolio enhances who you are as a candidate, helps you stand out from other applicants, and puts you at the head of the line to get the job. It is a much better way to market your strengths and abilities by providing a creative way in presenting them. The portfolio was created using React. This application is deployed using GitHub pages.
